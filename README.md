This repository contains the code for prediction of olive oils origin using different classification methods. The data set contains spectroscopic measurements of 65 olive oil samples originating from three regions: Crete, Peloponese and Other. The following methods are used for prediction: k-nearest neighbours, fully-grown tree and pruned tree, random forest and support vector machines models.
